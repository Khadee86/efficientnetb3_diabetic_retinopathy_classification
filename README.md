# Diabetic Retinopathy Classifier with XAI (Streamlit App)

This project is a web-based application for multi-class classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR) using **EfficientNetB0** model with integrated **explainable AI** techniques: **Grad-CAM++** and **LIME**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a retina image and classify DR severity with EfficientNet B0
- View Grad-CAM++ heatmap of model focus
- View LIME explanation of prediction
- Built with Streamlit for fast and clean UI

---

## 🧠 DR Classification Levels
- **0** — No DR
- **1** — Mild
- **2** — Moderate
- **3** — Severe
- **4** — Proliferative DR
